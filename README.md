Oh my!

This [hackblag](http://github.com/fredrikmollerstrand/hackblag) is an experiment in small-scale communication. The topic of discussion is the code I write and the ideas I am exposed to while hacking the world wide data nets.

Instead of posting updates to a webberblog powered by Wordpress, I fire up my trusty text-editor and write a piece of markdown'd text which I then push to github. Simple, efficient - and shamelessly stolen from [Reg Braithwaite's Homoiconic](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic).

I'm [Fredrik](http://fredrikmollerstrand.se/) and I work as a data scientist at [Burt](http://burtcorp.com/). You should [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/lenbust).
