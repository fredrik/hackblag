Well!

This [hackblag](http://github.com/fredrikmollerstrand/hackblag) is an experiment in small-scale communication. The topic of discussion is the code I write and the ideas I am exposed to while writing my master thesis. Instead of posting updates to a webberblog in the old-school fashion, I fire up my trusty text-editor, write a piece of text in markdown, and push it to github. Simple, efficient - and shamelessly stolen from [Reg Braithwaite's Homoiconic](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic).

So, who am I again? I'm [Fredrik](http://fredrikmollerstrand.se/); last-year student at [Chalmers](http://chalmers.se/) and intern-at-large at [last.fm](http://last.fm/), where [Per Andersson](http://github.com/avtobiff) and I are charged with whipping together a next-generation data store for in-house use.
